1.	Sign up for an AWS account: If you don't already have one, create an account at aws.amazon.com. 
 
2.	Create a new EC2 instance: Once you are signed in to your AWS account, navigate to the EC2 dashboard. From there, you can launch a new EC2 instance. You'll need to select the operating system and instance type that you want to use.
 
3.	Configure security settings: When you create a new EC2 instance, you'll also need to set up security settings. You can configure firewall rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic to your instance.
4.	Connect to your instance: Once your instance is up and running, you can connect to it using SSH or Remote Desktop, depending on your operating system.
5.	Install software: Once you have connected to your instance, you can install any software you need. This could include web servers, databases, or other applications.
6.	Set up storage: You'll also need to set up storage for your EC2 instance. This could include using Amazon EBS to attach additional disks, or using Amazon S3 for object storage.
 
7.	Monitor your instance: Finally, it's important to monitor your EC2 instance to make sure it is running smoothly. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor resource usage and set up alerts for when certain thresholds are reached.
