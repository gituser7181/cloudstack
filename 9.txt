Procedure:
1.	Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A VPC is a virtual network that you can configure in EC2 to isolate your resources from other AWS customers. You can create a VPC through the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

2.	Create subnets: Within your VPC, you can create subnets that define different portions of your network. For example, you might create one subnet for your web servers and another for your database servers. This helps to improve security and performance.

3.	Configure security groups: Security groups are like firewalls that control incoming and outgoing traffic to your instances. You can configure security groups to allow or deny specific types of traffic to your instances.
4.	Launch EC2 instances: EC2 instances are virtual machines that you can launch in your VPC. You can choose from a variety of instance types and operating systems to meet your needs.
 
5.	Configure instances: Once you have launched your instances, you can configure them with the necessary software and settings. For example, you might install a web server, a database server, or other applications.
6.	Set up load balancing and autoscaling: To improve performance and availability, you can set up load balancing and autoscaling. Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple instances, while autoscaling automatically adds or removes instances based on demand.
 
7.	Back up data: To ensure data is protected, it is recommended to regularly back up data using AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS snapshots or third-party solutions.
8.	Monitor and optimize performance: To ensure optimal performance, you can monitor your instances using AWS CloudWatch and other tools. You can also optimize performance by adjusting instance types, network configurations, and other settings.
